Effect: the sound file in your bundle you want to play.

Pitch: [0.5 to 2.0] think of it as the "note" of the sound. Giving a higher pitch number makes the sound play at a "higher note". A lower value will make the sound lower or "deeper". 1.0 is pitch of original file.

Pan: [-1.0 to 1.0] stereo affect. Below zero plays your sound more on the left side. Above 0 plays to the right. 0.0 is dead-center. (see note below)

Gain: [0.0 and up] volume. 1.0 is the volume of the original file.
